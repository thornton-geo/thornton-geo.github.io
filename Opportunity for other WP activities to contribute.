Opportunity for other WP activities to contribute. 

Can we develop a space for other Swiss partners to provide something Swiss specific? To make up for the fact that there was not time to submit something seperately. 

Landslides links with MeteoSuisse. Also UHOPs. Member

USe cases: Federal Office for Civil Protection. 

"Tangiable quantificable results". We could provide a bit the Swiss answer to what GEO wants. 

We can mention FOEN in the proposal.

MeteoSuisse is already in there: Fabio from MeteoSuisse, if the alternative proposals. 

National Centre for Climate Change Services. Meteosuiss warmings app could be a model: they could publish it openly. 

Great that they actually start to see the transferability of the existing Swiss apps (e.g. Alerts system). 

They have a law to publish these softwares as Open Source.
